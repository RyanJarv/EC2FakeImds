# IMDS nginx files

These files are served by nginx and take priority over the proxied metadata service. Some file/directories are intentionally blank as they will mess up the cloud-init process.

See main readme's [Fake IMDS Instance](https://github.com/RyanJarv/EC2FakeImds/blob/main/README.md#fake-imds-instance) section for more info.
